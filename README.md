# Time Drift

Time Drift is a fast-paced retro style car game where the player must navigate a moving car through oncoming obstacles, with the ability to slow time to assist with maneuvering.

## Game Controls

- Arrow Keys: Move the car around the screen.
- Space: Engages "time drift" which slows obstacle speed by 3x, but only while moving left or right.
- Escape: Pause and unpause the game.

## How to Play

You start the game at the center-bottom of the screen. As the game progresses, obstacles will come at you from the top and bottom of the screen. Your job is to avoid these obstacles for as long as you can.

The 'time drift' mechanic (activated with the space bar) can make your car slow down time, making it easier to avoid obstacles. However, you can only activate this while moving left or right.

Your score is based on the amount of time you are able to stay on the road. The longer you avoid obstacles, the higher your score. The game ends when you collide with an obstacle.
